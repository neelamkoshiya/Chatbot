Build Chatbot with Amazon Lex

Do you ever wonder how you would build a chatbot? Chatbot are conversational interface which can be accessed via text or speech. 
Below workshop highlights how you can have a chatbot for two usecases :

1) Pay my Bill
2) Reboot my system

We are assuming the system is a telecommincation device at customer's household or business which controls the service delivery like internet and television. On the other hand, "pay my bill" is more generic functionality. However since payment involves PCI complaince, we are assuming the pci data is handled in a different system and while performing the action for pay my bill, the customer is essentially providing "already saved" payment method. Just trying to keep it simple and decouple that part from this chatbot.

Well, without further ado, lets begin.
